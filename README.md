Your code needs to run in production, which has its own set of challenges and restrictions. In this course, instructor Miki Tebeka shows you how to convert your research notebook to production ready code. Learn about the needs of production, where notebooks can really help you, and where they might fall short. Explore why you should organize your code and how to write clean API for your modules, as well as how to structure your code with sub modules. Find out why testing your code is important and go over useful techniques and best practices. Plus, dive into dependency management, logging and metrics, performance tuning, securing your code, and more.
